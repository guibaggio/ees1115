Hello,

This folder contains the Python scripts for calculating the mean monthly and seasonal temperature and the e-folding time. These scripts contain several blocks that are commented. For instance, the efold.py file contains the code for calculating the lag-1 autocorrelation as well, but this code is commented for the sake of simplicity.
